/**** Check comments in the code to see the calculation of size ****/

1.Pixel (px)
•	Definition: “A pixel (px) is an absolute unit that represents a single dot on a screen. It is fixed and does not change with different screen sizes or user settings.”
•	Characteristics: “Pixels provide precise control over element dimensions. For example, width: 100px means the element will always be 100 pixels wide, regardless of the device or screen resolution.”
•	Usage: “Pixels are useful for elements that require exact dimensions, such as borders, images, and icons.”


2. em
•	Definition: “An em is a relative unit based on the font-size of the parent element. For instance, if the parent element has a font-size of 16px, then 1em equals 16px.”
•	Characteristics: “Ems allow for flexible and scalable design. Changing the font-size of a parent element affects all child elements using em units. This can lead to a compounding effect.”
•	Usage: “Commonly used for typography and spacing that need to adapt to varying font sizes, such as padding, margin, and line-height.”


3.rem
•	Definition: “A rem is a relative unit based on the font-size of the root element, typically the <html> element. For example, if the root font-size is 16px, then 1rem equals 16px.”
•	Characteristics: “Rems provide a consistent scaling factor throughout the document. Unlike ems, rems do not compound based on their parent elements.”
•	Usage: “Ideal for maintaining consistent sizing across the entire site, such as base font sizes and layout spacing.”


Flexibility:
•	px: “Pixels are fixed and provide precise control, but they lack flexibility. They do not adapt to different screen sizes or user settings, which can impact accessibility.”
•	em: “Ems are flexible and adapt to the font-size of their parent element. This allows for responsive designs but can lead to unpredictable results due to the compounding effect.”
•	rem: “Rems are also flexible but based on the root element’s font-size. This avoids the compounding issue and ensures consistent scaling across the document.”
Scalability:
•	px: “Pixels do not scale well with different screen sizes or user preferences, potentially causing accessibility issues.”
•	em: “Ems scale well with changes in parent font sizes, making them good for responsive design.”
•	rem: “Rems provide the best scalability by maintaining consistent proportions based on the root font-size, making them excellent for global styles.”
Use Cases:
•	px: “Best for precise control over specific elements like borders, icons, and fixed-width layouts.”
•	em: “Ideal for components that need to scale with parent elements, like buttons or nested text elements.”
•	rem: “Preferred for setting base sizes and spacing across the entire site, ensuring a cohesive and scalable design.”


Pros and Cons
px:
•	Pros: “Predictable and exact dimensions, easy to understand and implement.”
•	Cons: “Not responsive, poor scalability, and can lead to accessibility issues.”
em:
•	Pros: “Flexible and responsive to parent elements, good for typography and adaptable design.”
•	Cons: “Compounding effect can be unpredictable and make maintenance difficult.”
rem:
•	Pros: “Consistent scaling, avoids compounding issues, great for global styles and responsive design.”
•	Cons: “Less control over individual elements if not combined with other units or careful styling.”
VS Code Editor
Explanation:
•	“The first box is 100px wide and high. It remains the same size regardless of any other styling changes.”
•	“The second box is 10em, which scales based on the font-size of its parent. Notice how the nested 10em box inside the .parent element changes its size relative to the 2rem font-size.”
•	“The third box is 10rem, which scales based on the root element’s font-size. It maintains a consistent size regardless of its nesting.”
Recommendation:
•	“Use px for precise control when needed, but be mindful of its lack of scalability. Use em for flexible designs that need to respond to parent elements, but be aware of the compounding effect. Use rem for consistent, scalable designs across your entire site, leveraging its root-based scaling.”
